      <text>cognitive load: the amount of mental effort that we use to get the information that we need. A good data visualization minimizes the cognitive load while also communicating the message accurately. There are three types of cognitive load:

        <tspan x="20" dy="1.5em">intrinsic: baseline cognitive load pertaining to how much brain power is needed to understand an idea. Different types of tasks will require more or less thought or attention.</tspan>
        <tspan x="20" dy="1.5em">extraneous: amount of extra brain power needed to perceive and understand a topic</tspan>
        <tspan x="20" dy="1.5em">germane: a way for the brain to look for patterns to develop context. As with extraneous load, it is to help take a cognitive issue and present it in an easy and meaningful way. We'll use these three types of cognitive loads
          instinctively throughout this specialization.</tspan>
