        This presentation is written entirely in SVG, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Each slide is a standalone mini-webapp, and they are bound together and ordered by a master list in a Javascript file referenced by each slide.  Some slides are traditional, with lists of bullet points, while other slides are interactive Web applications that demonstrate the technology or use case being explained; if in doubt... start clicking on stuff.

        To move from slide to slide, press the right arrow button to move to the next slide, and the left arrow button to move to the previous slide.  In some cases, the arrow keys may be in use in the context of the slide; in this case, explicit links to the next and previous page are provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        To step through the bullet points on each slide, press the down arrow key to go forward, and the up arrow key to go backward.
