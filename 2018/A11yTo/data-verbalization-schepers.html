    <h2>1: Data Verbalization: how you can make your data accessible to everyone</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2: What is data visualization?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fancy word for charts and graphs</li>
      <li>includes diagrams</li>
      <li>"Story about data"</li>
      <li>User interface for data (come back to that)</li>
      <li>"The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures." – Ben Shneiderman, dataviz pioneer</li>
      <li>Create a functional model of the data in the minds of the audience</li>
      <li>reduce effort and catch attention in data-flooded world</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section>
  <h2>3: Data visualization is accessibility technology</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>(show large spreadsheet)</li>
  <li>(show equivalent visualization)</li>
  <li>Much easier to notice and think about patterns</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>4: Why visual?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>visual channel: 10 million bits / second</li>
  <li>30–60% of brain dedicated to visual processing
    <ul>
      <li>fast visual response: "seeing dinner or being dinner"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>touch: 8%, hearing: 2%</li>
  <li>Detect, match, and make sense of patterns</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>5: How the mind works</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Cognitive load and clutter</li>
  <li>Illustrate the principles of visual perception</li>
  <li>Strategically use contrast in visualizations</li>
  <li>Define and use pre-attentive attributes</li>
  <li>Declutter your visualization</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>6: How visualizations work</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Visual encoding: color, position, shape, size</li>
  <li>Pre-attentive attributes: immediately noticeable
    <ul>
      <li>color hue</li>
      <li>color brightness</li>
      <li>color saturation</li>
      <li>texture</li>
      <li>orientation</li>
      <li>position & alignment</li>
      <li>size</li>
      <li>shape</li>
      <li>movement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gestalt principles
    <ul>
      <li>Proximity</li>
      <li>Similarity</li>
      <li>Enclosure</li>
      <li>Closure</li>
      <li>Continuity</li>
      <li>Connection</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>7: "Hey, look over here!"</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>WCAG 1.4.1 "Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)"</li>
    https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html
  <li>Consider adding annotations or other specific semantic markers to draw attention
  <ul>
      <li>use pre-attentive attributes to draw attention, but then compose the data interface to create a model
      <li>assemble those elements to help people think
  <ul>
      <li>clearly</li>
      <li>accurately</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>using too many encodings leads to confusion</li>
  <li>goals
    <ul>
      <li>perceive the data</li>
      <li>think about the data</li>
      <li>reason with the data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>8: Fast and slow</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious
    <ul>
      <li>pre-attentive attributes</li>
      <li>gestalt principles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious
    <ul>
      <li>thinking about meaning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>dataviz uses fast visual systems to convey data, then slow systems to allow user to explore it and think about it</li>
  <li>slow system
    <ul>
      <li>cognitively expensive (mentally taxing)</li>
      <li>… slow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>goal is to reduce the speed and effort in accomplishing tasks in a non-visual way</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>9: Cognitive vs Perceptual Design Distinction</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>cognitive load: the amount of mental effort that we use to get the information that we need. A good data visualization minimizes the cognitive load while also communicating the message accurately. There are three types of cognitive load,
    <ul>
      <li>intrinsic: baseline cognitive load pertaining to how much brain power is needed to understand an idea. Different types of tasks will require more or less thought or attention.</li>
      <li>extraneous: amount of extra brain power needed to perceive and understand a topic</li>
      <li>germane: a way for the brain to look for patterns to develop context. As with extraneous load, it is to help take a cognitive issue and present it in an easy and meaningful way. We'll use these three types of cognitive loads instinctively throughout this specialization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>10: Memories</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Sensory: hyper-short-term , automatic
    <ul>
      <li>iconic memory: visual, 100ms duration, light trails (gone in a flash)</li>
      <li>haptic memory: touch, ~2s duration, only recently identified, not much is known</li>
      <li>echoic memory: auditory, 3-4s duration, high-density</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Short-term: information encoding and storing</li>
  <li>Long-term: more about recall, less immediately relevant to dataviz, but visual does help with retention (would other sensory encodings help, too? further study)</li>


  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>11: Affordance and Equivalence</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Long lost Jane Austin novel</li>
  <li>Each feature of the chart includes an affordance and a set of tasks that it is geared toward
    <ul>
      <li>Affordances</li>
      <li>For each affordance or task, we need to isolate the channel and mechanism and find accessible equivalent. Maybe iconic memory can be replaced with echoic or haptic?</li>
      <li>Reduce cognitive load as much as possible</li>
      <li>Anticipate user's needs</li>
      <li>Tasks are typically implicit: comparison with other data point, position in trend, assessment with regard to whole, categorizing (filtering/sorting), navigation/focus</li>
      <li>For each task, we need to make it explicit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>12: Dashboards</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>multiple charts on the same page</li>
  <li>usually interrelations between charts</li>
  <li>priorities:
    <ul>
      <li>let the user know there are multiple charts (easy!)</li>
      <li>describe the purpose of each chart (may be manual)</li>
      <li>describe how the charts relate to each other (may be manual)</li>
      <li>Good news! You already made these decisions when you designed the dashboard, so you can just write a short description, and that will benefit everyone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>13: One size does not fit all</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>In general, you should make sure that your dataviz is perceptible to all</li>
  <li>But knowing your audience is important
    <ul>
      <li>Different audiences may have more or less expertise in a topic, or have different goals</li>
      <li>Some differences may be cognitive ability</li>
      <li>Create user personas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider your target audience, and create your dataviz with them as your primary focus</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>14: Deep Graphics</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Images with extra information behind them</li>
  <li>Embed data</li>
  <li>Add links to data source</li>
  <li>Lots of possibilities, accessibility is only the first</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>15: Free pass</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Until recently, most data visualizations were not called out in accessibility assessments</li>
  <li>"Write alt text or long description"</li>
  <li>"Create a hidden data table"</li>
  <li>"You can't make dashboards accessible": "I’ll begin by stating my fundamental position: a dashboard that is accessible to the blind is a contradiction in terms." - Stephen Few https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1756</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>16: A table is not equivalent access</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>increased burden on the user</li>
  <li>doesn't explicitly show many relationships in data</li>
  <li>if a table were just as accessible, we wouldn't use data viz</li>
  <li>Landscape is changing, and it will be increasingly hard to get a free pass</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>17: Pretty persuasions</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Find the right way to convince your organization to be early adopters of accessible dataviz</li>
  <li>Credibility and ethics are important to data scientists. Get the data scientist on your side.</li>
  <li>Doesn't cost any more than inaccessible charts, and no more difficult; dataviz already generated by library, just use accessible one</li>
  <li>Embedding data in your visualization is better for users for
    <ul>
      <li>reuse</li>
      <li>SEO</li>
      <li>smart speakers and voice services</li>
      <li>restyling / rebranding</li>
      <li>future proofing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>18: Levels of accessibility in dataviz</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>0: None (benefit: can be automated)</li>
  <li>1. Provide generic alt-txt: "barchart", "pie chart of market segment size"</li>
  <li>2. Provide detailed summary in alt-txt: "Line chart showing market trends, with a downward trend over the last year", "bar chart with 12 bars; the highest value is 1500"</li>
  <li>3. Provide hidden content (e.g. a table) with the same information</li>
  <li>4. Serial access to data: table alternative</li>
  <li>5. Automatically generic task-oriented contextual options</li>

  </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>19: User interface for data</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Different types of data visualizations are optimized for performing different tasks
